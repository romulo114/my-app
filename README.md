# Purchase Order Bulk Insert Feature

## Description

This project implements a feature that allows employees to bulk insert purchase order information. It consists of a front-end web interface and a back-end API service. Users can submit purchase order details through a form, including the date, vendor name, and a CSV file containing information about the products (Model Number, Unit Price, Quantity). The application validates the submitted data and displays success messages or validation errors accordingly. Valid submissions are saved in a storage system.
